# Learning
Learn GitHub from Osama Al-Zero and  Gharib

## Notes for learning 
. Ghareeb Y.Channel (introduction) git and github ......

Git -->
distributed version control system
historical back-up = save as 
team based development , trank based development 
using commond line rather than GUI
support parallel work not sequential 

GitHub -->
git = local
github = using git but by using cloud ☁
project test (same project)
you can revert changes as administrator 
sources (Gitlab , BitBucket) -- sites
fork = copy from another person and changes don't affect my

. Learning from Ghareeb ......

clear + Enter = cleaning 
git status
touch anyname. extension = add file 
staging area = وراء الستارة
repo = ع المسرح اهو 
git checkout awkldjo2j2oijo1ko1 = back step
clone = time line = instance = branch
git branch anyname = create branch
git remote -v = to check connection
git remote add origin (link)= to connection



. (Learning) O.zeroo .....
famous words 

repository مستودع (شركه) - بحط فيه اكواد البروجيكت كامله
branch (فرع) - عايز تضيف حاجه في المشروع الاساسي 
local repo = pc
remote repo = site or server
commit =snapshot or checkpoint in your local repo عملت تعديل معين في اللوكال
clone = copy repo from loacl or remote --> local = from location to another in pc
push = upload local changes to remote
pull = pull changes from remote repo to local
pull request = tell other about your changes to pull it from local to remote

 . Important Rule ....
create repo for every project (not one for all)
create a new branch for every feature or enhancement 
anyone can push and pull depend on permission
